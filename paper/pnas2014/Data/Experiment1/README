Experiment 1 is the full halo and hyperbole experiment.
raw.txt is the raw data directly downloaded from mTurk.
clean.txt is the raw data minus unnecessary fields (produced by processRaw.py raw.txt)
long.csv is in semi-long form, with each item/utterance pair in one line, but ratings for all meanings in one line (produced by processClean.py clean.txt)
stretched.csv is in long form, with each item/utterance/meaning in one line. Unormalized. (produced by processLong.py long.csv)
normalized.csv is in long form, with each item/utternace/meaning in one line. Normalized so the ratings for each item/utterance pair sums to 1. (produced by processLong_normalize.py long.csv)
